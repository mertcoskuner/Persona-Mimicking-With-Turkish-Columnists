## 📝 Overview

This repository is part of the ENS492 Graduation Project and aims to simulate rich and contextual dialogues between Large Language Models (LLMs) mimicking Turkish columnists. The goal is to explore the dynamics of AI communication both internally (LLM-to-LLM) and externally (User-to-LLM).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- numpy==2.2.3
- pandas==2.2.3
- python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
- pytz==2025.1
- six==1.17.0
- tzdata==2025.1


## 📌 Project Objectives

- Enable **LLM-to-LLM Communication**: Simulate dynamic and meaningful dialogues between multiple LLMs.
- Facilitate **User-to-LLM Interaction**: Allow users to interact with LLMs through text-based inputs.
- Investigate LLM dynamics in various scenarios, including collaborative and competitive interactions.
- Explore real-world applications of LLM dialogues in fields like education, entertainment, and AI research.

## 🚀 Features

- **LLM-to-LLM Dialogues**: Simulate rich and structured conversations between multiple LLM instances.
- **Persona-Based Communication**: Assign unique personas to LLMs for diverse and contextually tailored interactions.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Set initial prompts for LLMs to guide and shape their dialogues.
- **Interactive Backend**: Built with Flask or Django for scalable and efficient API services.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Large Language Models**: Powered by cutting-edge LLMs (e.g., Meta-Llama, TURKCELL-LLM, YTU-Cosmos, Gemma-2).
- **Backend**: Flask/Django for API and model serving.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit UI for enhanced user engagement.

## 💡 Use Cases

- AI-powered social platforms with engaging dialogues.
- Virtual assistants capable of dynamic, multi-agent communication.
- Simulation tools for dialogue research and analysis.
- Educational tools for AI-driven learning experiences.
